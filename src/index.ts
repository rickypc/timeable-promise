 *
 * Collection of asynchronous utilities for managing concurrency,
 * sequencing, and timing. Provides helpers for running tasks in
 * parallel or sequential order, controlling execution with timeouts,
 * and working with settled promise results.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * ```bash
 * yarn add timeable-promise || npm install --save timeable-promise
 * ```
 *
 * ## Importing
 *
 * This package supports two styles of import:
 *
 * 1. Named exports from the entry point:
 * ```ts
 * import { chunk, ..., waitFor } from 'timeable-promise';
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Direct path imports for individual utilities:
 * ```ts
 * import chunk from 'timeable-promise/chunk';
 * ```
 *
 * Use whichever style fits your project. Named exports are convenient when you
 * need several utilities at once, while direct path imports can reduce bundle
 * size if you only need one.
 *
 * > This package is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions
 * > out of the box. Your editor will offer autocomplete and type safety
 * > automatically.
 *
 * For the full list of exports, refer to the [API Call Graph](#api-call-graph).
