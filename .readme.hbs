Development Dependencies
-
You will need to install [Node.js](https://bit.ly/2SMCGXK) as a local
development dependency. The `npm` package manager comes bundled with all
recent releases of `Node.js`. You can also use [yarn](https://bit.ly/3nmWS1K)
as a package manager.

`yarn` or `npm install` will attempt to resolve any `npm` module dependencies
that have been declared in the projectâ€™s `package.json` file, installing them
into the `node_modules` folder.

```bash
$ yarn
# or
$ npm install
```

Run Benchmark, Leak, Lint, and Unit Tests
-

```bash
$ yarn test
# or
$ npm run test:lint; npm run test:unit; npm run test:bench; npm run test:leak
```
